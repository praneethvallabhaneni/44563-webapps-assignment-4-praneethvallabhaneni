                  Ring forth, ye bells,
                        With clarion sound—
                  Forget your knells,
                        For joys abound.
                  Forget your notes
                        Of mournful lay,
                  And from your throats
                        Pour joy to-day.
                        For to-day young Alexis—young Alexis Pointdextre
                        Is betrothed to Aline—to Aline Sangazure,
                  And that pride of his sex is—of his sex is to be next her
                        At the feast on the green—on the green, oh, be sure!
          
                                   Ring forth, ye bells etc.
